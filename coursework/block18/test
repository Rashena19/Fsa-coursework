Alternative Test Specifications:

Expect multiplication(2, 3) to return a number.
Expect multiplication(2, 3) to return 6.
Expect multiplication(0, 3) to return 0.

Expect multiplication("a", 3) to throw an error (invalid input: non-numeric string).
Expect multiplication(2, null) to throw an error (invalid input: null).
Expect multiplication([], 3) to throw an error (invalid input: array instead of number).
Expect multiplication({}, 3) to throw an error (invalid input: object instead of number).

2. A function called "concatOdds" that takes two arrays of integers as arguments and returns an array with odd numbers in ascending order.
Alternative Test Specifications:

Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to return [-1, 1, 1, 3, 9, 15].
Expect concatOdds([2, 4, 6], [8, 10, 12]) to return an empty array [].
Expect concatOdds([5, 3, 9], []) to return [3, 5, 9].
Expect concatOdds([], [11, 7, 13]) to return [7, 11, 13].
Expect concatOdds([1, 3, 5], [3, 5, 7]) to return [1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7].
Expect concatOdds([1, 3, 5], [-5, -3, -1]) to return [-5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5].
Expect concatOdds([1, 2, 3], ["a", 5, 7]) to throw an error (invalid input: array with non-integer elements).
Expect concatOdds([1, 2, 3], [5, 7, undefined]) to throw an error (invalid input: undefined in array).
Expect concatOdds([1, 3, 3, 5], [5, 5, 5]) to return [1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5].
Expect concatOdds([1.5, 2, 3.5], [5, 7]) to return [1.5, 3.5, 5, 7] (support for float odd numbers).
Expect concatOdds([11, 2, 9], [3, -5, 7]) to return [-5, 3, 7, 9, 11].

3. A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.
Test Specifications:

When the user is logged in and clicks "Proceed to Checkout" with items in the cart, they should be taken to the checkout page with their details pre-filled and the option to review their order.
When the user is logged in and clicks "Proceed to Checkout" with no items in the cart, they should be shown an error or prompt that the cart is empty, with an option to return to shopping.
When the user is logged out and clicks "Proceed to Checkout" with items in the cart, they should be asked if they want to create an account or log in to complete the purchase.
When the user clicks "Checkout as Guest" with items in the cart, they should be allowed to proceed to checkout as a guest without needing to create an account or log in.
When the user checks out as a guest, they should be asked to provide their shipping and billing information, but they should not be required to create an account.
When the user clicks "Create Account" during guest checkout, they should be prompted to create an account before proceeding with payment.
When the user clicks "Login" during guest checkout, they should be prompted to log in with existing credentials.
When the cart is empty and the user clicks "Proceed to Checkout", they should be shown a message such as "Your cart is empty" with the option to continue shopping.
When the user enters their payment details during checkout, the payment information should be validated (e.g., credit card number, expiration date, and security code should be in the correct format).
When the user enters invalid payment information (e.g., expired credit card, wrong card number), they should be shown an error message indicating what information is incorrect.
When the user selects a shipping address during checkout, they should be able to either enter a new address or choose a saved one from their account (if logged in).
When the user selects a shipping method, they should be shown the corresponding shipping costs and estimated delivery times.
When the user checks out, they should receive an order confirmation page summarizing their purchase details (items, total price, shipping address, etc.).
When the user successfully places an order, they should receive an email confirmation of their purchase.
When the user clicks "Back to Shopping" from the checkout page, they should be redirected to the shopping cart or product selection page.
When the user tries to checkout with more items than available in stock, they should be shown a message indicating that certain items are out of stock and given an option to modify the cart.
